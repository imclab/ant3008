# Digital Media Art Workshop  
Spring 2014

**Course Number:** ANT3008  
**Credit:** 3  
**Enrollment Eligibility:** 2, 3, 4  
**Class Time:** Mon 15:00~16:15, Wed 16:30~17:45      
**Classroom:** AS111     
**Course Website:** http://jiharu.github.io/ant3008/    
**Class Portfolio:** http://www.openprocessing.org/classroom/3620     
**Instructors:** Hyunkyung (Haru) Ji         
**Office:** X407 (Hours: Fri 14:00 - 18:00) meeting will be set up by mail.


The goal of this class is for students to understand **theoretical aspects and important concepts in the digital media art field** and **to learn how to create visual and audio expressions through programming**, using one of the most widely used media arts tools today: [Processing](http://www.processing.org). Processing is designed for artists to create computational art using algorithmic techniques. The class starts at beginner level and will end at an intermediate level and students will work in **collaboration while joining multiple teams (at least two each)**.

Along with small assignments and team presentations during the class, for evaluation, students will submit their research and multimedia project expressing their open-ended creative exploration.

Students will learn: 

1) What are important issues and historical events in the Digital Media Art field.    
2) What is computational art, and what are its structure and components.    
3) What to express: gain good understanding and inspiration of digital media.   
4) How to use Processing and how to create visual and audio systems and art (expression).

Creating and expressing artistic intentions with sensory data with computers (computational arts) asks students for a very strong interdisciplinarity (especially between liberal arts, science and engineering) and an open-minded attitude.

### Prerequisites 

Willing motivation and an open-minded perspective.

### Course format

The class will consist of theory and practice. Parts of the classes will be lecture-based, drawing upon the structure of our subject using presentations (30%), while other parts will take a workshop format using computer software (30%). Students will also contribute to the class by presenting team research and practice (20%). The remainder will be discussion (20%).

Students will share their homework through the Openprocessing website - (http://www.openprocessing.org/classroom/3620).

Questions and discussion are encouraged during the class time.

### Evaluation

1) Small assignments to evaluate how students follow the class topics (30%).     
	(When you submit, please name your assignment as the following format: yourschoolid_name_date.extension)    
2) Mid-term: team presentation on the research topic (20%) and quiz (10%).     
3) Final-term: project (30%).

Participation and collaboration will also be counted (10%).

### Course policies

Using the software:

1) Processing	is	an	open,	cross-platform	software.	Please	download	and	install	from: http://processing.org/

Online materials: class notes (http://jiharu.github.io/ant3008/) & students portfolio (http://www.openprocessing.org/classroom/3620)

- Regular updates of your work on time is important, and will be reflected to the grade.

Students must bring __headphones/earphones__ to use sound in the AS111 lab. Students should use __a USB stick or web hard space__ to save their work, since **the computers in AS111 are wiped daily**.

2) Support for the disabled: seat support/ Extensions on homework’s and project submissions/ TA support etc.

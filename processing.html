# Processing

&lt;img src="img/P.jpg" align="right" &gt;

> Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks. One of the stated aims of Processing is to act as a tool to get non-programmers started with programming, through the instant gratification of visual feedback. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language))

Processing focuses on creating "images, animations, and interactions" within an integrated textual programming environment. Although it was designed as a sketching and pedagogical tool, today "there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production." [Processing](http://www.processing.org/)

It is one of the most widely used platforms for digital visual arts and creative coding projects today. It is multi-OS and can run in a web browser, it has been extended with many great libraries, integrates well with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) for hardware sensors, and has been [ported to JavaScript](http://processingjs.org/) for better integration in today's browsers.

### Getting Processsing

Processing is the open software and supports cross-platform. Please download and install from [http://processing.org/](http://processing.org/).

If you have any problems installing it, you can always try [running it in the browser](http://sketch.processing.org/) -- not everything will work, but enough to get started.

### Support materials and references

Two recommended textbooks:

- *Getting Started with Processing*  
Casey Reas and Ben Fry. Published June 2010, O'Reilly Media. 208 pages. Paperback.
- *Learning Processing: A Beginner's Guide to Programming Images, Animation, and Interaction*  
Daniel Shiffman. Published August 2008, Morgan Kaufmann. 450 pages. Paperback.

In addition there are numerous help, tutorial, example and reference files in the Processing software, on the [Processing website](http://www.processing.org) and [elsewhere](http://www.google.com). There are huge amounts of example code and projects available on [OpenProcessing](http://openprocessing.org/) for example.

# Getting Started

Take a look at the first [Processing tutorial](http://www.processing.org/learning/gettingstarted/) -- this is also linked from the Processing Help menu. 

Here's our first program. In processing, programs are also known as *sketches*:

```
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  line(100, 250, 300, 250);
}
```

- **Don't copy & paste code**: type it by hand! Doing things by hand requires full attention to detail and develops vital subconscious skills; these will help you enormously when you start inventing your own projects.

- **Watch out for punctuation**: especially the three different kinds of brackets ```() {} []``` and the semicolon ```;``` at the end of each line!

- Be careful to **indent the code properly**. Indent any lines between a block start curly bracket ```{``` and a block end curly bracket ```}```. You can use *Tools->Auto Format* (or command-T keys) to do this automatically. Although the code may work, indenting is really helpful to understand the code, and is a good habit to get into.

We can run this program, or sketch, by clicking on the triangle run button in Processing, or pressing Command-R; it should open a window looking something like this:

![first sketch](img/first_sketch.png) 

If you make a mistake in writing the code, the program will probably fail to run (or if you get lucky, it might run and do something unexpected...). A message will display in the *console* area, which might help you find the error.

## What does it mean? 

Maybe you can guess what this does? 

### What is *setup* and *draw*?

We can see there are two parts to our program; the first part goes ```void setup()...``` and the second part goes ```void draw()...```. These parts of the program are called **functions**, because they describe what the program can do ("how it functions"). The function called ```draw``` makes sense; Processing is primarily an environment for making programs that draw graphics. The function called ```setup``` does whatever work is needed in order to set up the system to start drawing; in this case it defines the size of the canvas. 

The ```setup``` and ```draw``` function names have special meaning in Processing; they will be automatically *called* by the Processing environment at special times:

- when a program (sketch) starts, Processing calls the ```setup``` function once.
- after that, Processing calls the ```draw``` function several times a second, so that we can make moving images just like animators do.

So whatever we put inside ```setup``` will happen once when the sketch starts, and whatever we put in ```draw``` will happen whenever Processing updates the canvas. 

> Technical detail: A function collects a series of **instructions** together in a sequence, rather like a recipe. So the ```draw``` function is a recipe for making images. 

Let's add some more instructions, more code, into ```draw```:

```
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  line(100, 250, 300, 250);
  line(200, 200, 200, 220);
}
```

So what do ```size``` and ```line``` do? They are **built-in** functions, which are predefined by Processing. There are lots and lots of built-in functions, for all kinds of purposes. They are the basic ingredients for a recipe, and they are all listed online in the [Processing Language API](http://www.processing.org/reference/). 

Let's look there to see what ```size``` means. We can either search for it manually in the list, or we can select and right-click on the word ```size``` and choose **Find in Reference**. 

There's a lot of information there, because although we start simple, Processing can get quite powerful; but usually the most important parts are *Description*, *Syntax* and *Parameters*. The syntax tells us the correct ways(s) to write the function, and the parameters explain how to make the function behave in different ways. 

Here are the important parts:

> **Description:** Defines the dimension of the display window in units of pixels...   
> **Syntax:** ```size(w, h)```  
> **Parameters:** ```w``` int: width of the display window in units of pixels  
> **Parameters:** ```h``` int: height of the display window in units of pixels

OK, so for our code, ```size(400, 400);```, the ```400``` corresponds to ```w``` and ```400``` corresponds to ```h``` in the syntax.  So, our ```size(400, 400);``` means:

> Define the dimension of the display with a height of 400 pixels and 400 pixels.

## But, what's a pixel?

You can think of it that all graphics rendering in Processing are drawn on good old graph paper. The screen is a grid of *picture elements*, or **pixels** for short, like the boxes in graph paper. Each pixel can have one color. All images you see on the computer are made of pixels. To draw a line, you can *fill in* a row of pixels:

![Coordinate system](img/coordinates.jpg)

> To tell the computer which box to start drawing from, or to finish drawing, you need to identify the box by it's position on the canvas. We use **X** for the horizontal position along the page (the column), and **Y** for the vertical position down the page (the row). Every box has a unique X,Y pair to identify it; this is called the coordinate. Almost all drawing in Processing is defined in terms of **pixel positions (coordinates)** and **pixel sizes (dimensions)**.

There's a great tutorial about this [here](http://www.processing.org/learning/drawing/). 

OK, so now we know that when our program starts, it runs our ```setup``` function, which contains the ```size(400, 400)``` instruction, which creates a canvas that has 400 rows and 400 columns of pixels. 

We can probably make a good guess as to what the ```line``` calls mean too! 

If we check the reference, it says the ```line(...)``` function "draws a line to the screen", and the parameters set the 'x' (horizontal) and 'y' (vertical) coordinates of the start position, followed by the 'x' (horizontal) and 'y' (vertical) coordinates of the end position, of the line. So our first line goes from position 200, 200 to psotion 200, 220. Our second line goes from position 100, 250 to position 300, 250. 

Try changing some of these numbers and running the sketch to see what it does. Drawing like this is part of the reason why the ancestor of Processing was called *Design by Numbers*. 

OK, now we understand what the code is doing, we should add our understanding to our document, by adding *comments*. Any line can be a comment by adding two slashes at the start:

```
// what to do the when the program first starts up:
void setup() {
  // create a canvas of 400 wide by 400 high pixels:
  size(400, 400);
}

// what to do when the canvas should be drawn:
void draw() {
  // draw a line from 100, 250 to 300, 250:
  line(100, 250, 300, 250);
  // draw a line from 200, 200 to 200, 220:
  line(200, 200, 200, 220);
}
```

Your code will still work even if you don't indent it propery or add comments, but you will have a far more difficult time understanding what it does when you look at it again a week or two later, or if you show it to somebody else (e.g. the professors...) Many wise programmers say: **"code is more often read than written"**. 

## Algorithmic painter

What else can we draw besides lines? Take a look at the reference to understand the ```rect``` and ```ellipse``` functions. Let's try adding an ellipse:

```
// what to do the when the program first starts up:
void setup() {
  // create a canvas of 400 wide by 400 high pixels:
  size(400, 400);
}

// what to do when the canvas should be drawn:
void draw() {
  // draw a line from 100, 250 to 300, 250:
  line(100, 250, 300, 250);
  // draw a line from 200, 200 to 200, 220:
  line(200, 200, 200, 220);
  // draw an ellipse centered at 200, 200
  // with width 300 and height 300:
  ellipse(200, 200, 300, 300);
}
```

Wait -- what happened to our lines?

The problem is that when we draw the ellipse, it *draws over the top* of our lines. Processing draws with the *Painter's algorithm*, which means that each new thing drawn goes over the top of the one before, like oil painting on a canvas. It happened to use because the ```ellipse``` call happens *after* the ```line``` calls in our ```draw``` function (remember, the content of a function is like a recipe; each line happens after the line above it). OK, so we can fix this by changing the order:


```
// what to do the when the program first starts up:
void setup() {
  // create a canvas of 400 wide by 400 high pixels:
  size(400, 400);
}

// what to do when the canvas should be drawn:
void draw() {
  // first, draw an ellipse centered at 200, 200
  // with width 300 and height 300:
  ellipse(200, 200, 300, 300);
  
  // now draw some lines:
  // draw a line from 100, 250 to 300, 250:
  line(100, 250, 300, 250);
  // draw a line from 200, 200 to 200, 220:
  line(200, 200, 200, 220);
}
```

Okay. Can you make a face?

You can add ```smooth();``` to the ```setup``` function, to make the image look nicer, and ```strokeWeight(3);``` in ```setup``` to change the line thickness (weight, as in how hard your pen is pressed...). 

Try using ```fill(0);``` and ```fill(255);``` to paint in black or white, in different places within the ```draw``` function.

> The ```fill``` function "sets the color used to fill shapes". The matching syntax it uses here is ```fill(gray)```, where gray in this case is 255, which is a "number specifying value between white and black". In Processing, ```0``` is black, ```255``` is white, and numbers in between are different shades of gray. 

So ```fill(255);``` sets the color used to fill shapes to be white. That means, any objects drawn after this call will have white filling.

Remember, if anything doesn't work, try changing the order, or *commenting it out* by putting ```//``` in front of it.

## First Interaction 

Let's bring this to life. Try this:

```
// what to do the when the program first starts up:
void setup() {
  // create a canvas of 400 wide by 400 high pixels:
  size(400, 400);
  // make the lines look smooth:
  smooth();
  // make the lines look fat:
  strokeWeight(3);
}

// what to do when the canvas should be drawn:
void draw() {
  // paint in white:
  fill(255);
  // first draw the head:
  // an ellipse centered at 200, 200
  // with width 300 and height 300:
  ellipse(200, 200, 300, 300);
  
  // now draw some features:
  // paint in black:
  fill(0);
  
  // mouth
  // draw a rect from 100, 250 
  // with width 200 and height 20:
  rect(100, 250, 200, 20);
  
  // nose
  // draw a line from 200, 200 to 200, 220:
  line(200, 200, 200, 220);
  
  // eyes
  // more ellipses for the eyes:
  ellipse(130, 150, 80, 80);
  ellipse(270, 150, 80, mouseY);
}
```

At the end, the height of the last two ellipses are set to whatever the value of ```mouseY``` is. Again, we can look it up in the reference: "The system *variable* ```mouseY``` always contains the current horizontal coordinate of the mouse".

### What is a *system variable*?

> A variable is a container for data that can change while a program runs. Even though the data changes, the name of the variable stays the same, and that's how we can use it. The value of the variable ```mouseY``` gets changed automatically by Processing (because it is a *system* variable); the value stored in ```mouseY``` is automatically set to the value of the current mouse vertical position. 

There's ```mouseX``` of course -- see if you can find a good place to use it!

Since the values of ```mouseX``` and ```mouseY``` are always numbers, we can also use them wherever we could use numbers. This means we can do a bit of mathematics with them. For example, we can add and subtract, multiply or divide them. We can use this to make the eyes less sensitive:

```
// what to do the when the program first starts up:
void setup() {
  // create a canvas of 400 wide by 400 high pixels:
  size(400, 400);
  // make the lines look smooth:
  smooth();
  // make the lines look fat:
  strokeWeight(3);
}

// what to do when the canvas should be drawn:
void draw() {
  // paint in white:
  fill(255);
  // first draw the head:
  // an ellipse centered at 200, 200
  // with width 300 and height 300:
  ellipse(200, 200, 300, 300);
  
  // now draw some features:
  // paint in black:
  fill(0);
  
  // mouth
  // draw a rect from 100, 250 
  // with width 200 and height 20:
  rect(100, 250, 200, mouseX / 10);
  
  // nose
  // draw a line from 200, 200 to 200, 220:
  line(200, 200, 200, 220);
  
  // eyes
  // more ellipses for the eyes:
  ellipse(130, 150, 80, mouseY / 5);
  ellipse(270, 150, 80, mouseY / 5);
}
```

<!--
We can create other variables in our programs too, and read and change the data they contain. To do this, we need to learn another detail first. In Processing, and many other programming languages, variables also have a **type**, which never changes. The type of a variable defines what *kinds* of data it can contain. For example, **int** type variables always contain integers, which are whole numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3 etc. They cannot contain any other kind of data. So whenever we introduce a new variable name to the program (we *declare* it), we also need to tell Processing what type of data it will contain.

# Processing

&lt;img src="img/P.jpg" align="right" &gt;

> Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks. One of the stated aims of Processing is to act as a tool to get non-programmers started with programming, through the instant gratification of visual feedback. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language))

Processing focuses on creating "images, animations, and interactions" within an integrated textual programming environment. Although it was designed as a sketching and pedagogical tool, today "there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production." [Processing](http://www.processing.org/)

It is one of the most widely used platforms for digital visual arts and creative coding projects today. It is multi-OS and can run in a web browser, it has been extended with many great libraries, integrates well with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) for hardware sensors, and has been [ported to JavaScript](http://processingjs.org/) for better integration in today's browsers.

## Inspiration: [*Colorimetry in Motion*](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/colorimetry-in-motion-study-of-colour-by-nicolas-menard/)
We had a discussion about the project after we watched the intro-video of the project all together.
Here are some discussions and students' responses: 
### What do you think the subject of the project? (What/Why)
- Express sound through color and shapes, behaviors.
- Express color and shapes, behaviors through sound.
### What do you think in terms of the quality of the project?
- Color looks random, then it was not very inspiring.
- Movie is buffering but I can not understand why they put the long pause.
- Moving patterns were very boring.
- Speed of animation was organic not linear.
- The sound choice was very interesting because it was matching perfectly.
- The most aesthetically pleasing results are often close to nature.

-----------------------


### Lev Manovich’s analyses of how, through “computerization”, media became new media:
“All existing media are translated into numerical data accessible for the computer. The result: graphics, moving images, sounds, shapes, spaces, and texts become computable, that is, simply sets of computer data ... This meeting changes the identity of both media and the computer itself. No longer just a calculator, control mechanism, or communication device, the computer becomes a media processor.” (Manovich, 2001)

> - Overview: Creating final media installation contents(ideation) through research about various new media environments.	Our project will focus on reasearch about new media installations exhibited acroos vast amounts of space, creating immersive environments. (ex. Rain Room and Laser Forest). We will also have case studies on new media works in virtual reality projected across dome-shaped structures. Furthermore, our project will research about exhibiting virtual immersive environments through virtual reality headsets (ex. Oculus Rift). Our studies will be carried out from diverse perspectives - themes and philosophy behind work, aesthetics, and what kinds of tools and technology were utilized in order to create the artwork. We will also ask ourseleves what the role of "space" is in these immersive environments, how the works manipulate space, and how space can be manipulated inside virtual reality. 	
> - Member: 선근 is the communicator, 선근 will keep suggesting extension of idea, and will convey the main gist to the audience in class. 하은 is the logger who will keep track of everything(thoughts, ideas, inspirations, and suggestions) done and observed, 호원and 승기 is in charge of creating the final content of the research in the form of a video. We plan to actively share thoughts and ideas to make the best output.

### Our goal to understand for theoretical approach:
- Digital / Computer / Computerization / Computation
- Media
- Art / Media Art

### Our goal to understand for media art practice:
- What is my subject?
- What is its relations to its field?
- What is its relations to the world?

### Our goal to understand for digital media art history:
- The art history: who's point of view?
- The media (art) history: Manual -> Mechanic -> Ellectonic
- The history of a word 'creation':  

According to Tatarkiewicz, while the meaning of ‘art’ has become narrower, the use of a term ‘creativity’ became more widely used in the modern era. (Tatarkiewicz, 1980)

“The European concept of art has a very long history of some twenty-five centuries behind it. This long stretch of time falls broadly into two parts. The first period that of the ancient conception of art lasted from the fifth century B.C. up to the sixteenth century A.D. Throughout that period art was understood as production governed by ‘rules’.” (Tatarkiewicz, 1971)

According to Tatarkiewicz, the ancient definition of art shows two characteristics. First, the meaning or scope of a term ‘art’ was broader; it includes technology, science and crafts and thus implies machine art, decorative art, and commercial art. Second, unlike the vagueness of modern usage, the ancient definition was clearer: it demanded specific abilities and followed certain rules as its common features. For example, music became art, in the ancient meaning, only after the Pythagoreans discovered the laws of harmony and made harmony a subject of mathematical calculation. Art was the domain of trained professionals and technicians, and - unlike our modern conception - to express feelings or to follow an inspiration was not their business (Tatarkiewicz, 1971).

Etymologically, **art** is derived via old French from Latin ***ars*** and ***ars*** is a translation of the Greek ***τέχνη (techné)***; a root shared by the word **technology**. In his article **The Question Concerning Technology**, originally written in 1954, Heidegger states:
“There was a time when it was not technology alone that bore the name ‘techné’. Once that revealing which brings forth truth into the splendor of radiant appearance was also called ‘techné’... Once there was a time when the bringing-forth of the true into the beautiful was called ‘techné’. The ‘poiésis’ of the fine arts was also called ‘techné’.” (Heidegger)

The meaning of art has reduced its scope over history and has become completely separated from science and technology. Art, science and technology have almost completely forgotten their shared origins.

### What do we need to understand about the media (Learning from Marshall McLuhan)?
- The medium is message.
- Media Hot and Cold.
- Understanding media: The Extensions of Man.

"McLuhan suggested that we study the *properties* of a medium rather than the individual *messages* produced by media, thus the famous aphorism 'the medium is the message.' His point was that the things a medium does to a culture are more important than the content it conveys." - Bogost, How to do things with videogames, P4, 2011

"Marshall McLuhan saw automation as an extension of body and mind. His insight was that the near instantaneous speed of electricity reveals a degree of inter-relationship between systems as an “organic unity” similar to the electrically based central nervous system of the body. This instantaneity permits a perspective of body/mind and computer as analogical systems. Furthermore, McLuhan indicated that the coupling of this near instantaneous speed of electric media within systems of feedback underpins the phenomena of algorithmic autonomy. (McLuhan, 1963).

The speed of computation reveals relations between multiple events, properties, capacities, disciplines and so on which had been difficult to detect without electronic automation. As a result, it grants us predictive capacity over, and thus the capability to control, vastly more complex phenomena. In particular, it has made possible great advances in the scientific treatment of complex natural phenomena which had been resistant to analytical methods: phenomena characterized by massive quantities of inter-relationships and emergent behaviors."

## Generative Art

Generative art refers to art that is constructed in part according to rules, to some degree outside the author's control. Rules might include mechanical systems, materials with independent behaviors (such as water flow or chemical reactions), mathematical procedures, huge data-sets, geometries and symmetries, and of course randomization.

Generative artworks have existed throughout human history. Before computing, composers used strict rule systems (the counterpoint of Bach, the serialism of Schoenberg) as well as chance (the dice-game of Mozart and chance operations of Cage). Pointilism, cubism, and other abstractions in painting are rule-based constraints. Many writers refer to Sol LeWitt's textual instructions, to be carried out by others; a direction more fully fleshed out with alternative approaches to scorewriting in music. One might also mention kinetic sculpture and generative texts (particularly the Oulipo group), or the pattern-based arts of Islamic tiling and weaving, Celtic knots, and other traditional arts.

The more it is considered, the more it seems that all art is somewhat generative, and certainly technological. (It is worth noting that the Greek term techné is the origin of both art and technology.) However the term generative is usually used for art in which these systems play a major role in the work, with significant autonomy from the artist's urges. It thus invokes issues of distributed and non-human creativity.

Computing media nevertheless revolutionize generative art. A great deal of early computer art is generative by necessity, since the machines were expensive and difficult to use.

Tracing the fertile series of collaborations between arts and sciences throughout the twentieth century, Randall Packer and Ken Jordan present the often overlooked history behind multimedia--the interfaces, links, and interactivity we all take for granted today. "Many of the papers that had profound impact upon my development--to say nothing of the entire industry--are here," raves Donald A. Norman, author of The Invisible Computer. In "an evocative whirlwind tour through 100 years of work" (Wired), Packer and Jordan bring together an "historically significant" (Slashdot) collection of the groundbreaking visions of scientists like Vannevar Bush, Douglas Englebart, and Norbert Wiener, and artists like John Cage, Nam June Paik, and William Gibson. Their insightful explanations of the core concepts behind multimedia provide historical context that "reads like a Western civ of modern media" (Film/Tape World).

## AD

Seminars by Prof. Takashi Ikegami of Univ. Tokyo and by Prof. Mizuki Oka of Tsukuba Univ. 
on April 7th from 4:30pm 
at Room 113(1F), ITC Building(N1).

(1) Massive Data Flows : Self-organization of energy, material, and
information flows, Prof. Takashi Ikegami, Univ. of Tokyo

Abstract: 
As opposed to “big data” as a buzz word, we attempt to find a new pattern
or structure generated by self- organization in the flow of the massive
data. We call this approach Massive Data Flows (MDF). Rather than making
use of big data, we are interested in the new phenomena and theory that
allows us to deal with the data without losing the autonomy, complexity,
dynamics and structure that the data itself has. The concept of MDF
provides a new methodology for understanding data flows, including
material, energy and information flows. Analogous to the Darwinian
evolution and the organization of an ecological system, MDF patterns grow,
and this growth determines the organization of system’s own state
autonomously, i.e. organization of data by the data for the data,
Furthermore, self-organization of MDF is not caused by a closed internal
dynamics but it will be found at the interface between the endogenous and
exogenous data flows. MDF is the generic term that explains the co-
evolution of excess flows and the adaptive system in which self-
organizational patterns will successively occur. Composed by the
heterogeneous elements, MDF should possess self-referential, self-
modifying, self-sustaining and innovative dynamics. In this talk, we will
exemplify  concrete examples of MDF; the default mode network and the
excitability of the web, the autonomous sensor network, chemical oil
droplets, and court and cave computation with a many-core system as
potential MDF systems. 

(2) What makes the internet robust and adaptive? Prof. Mizuki Oka, Tsukuba
Univ.

abstract: 
In this study, we argue that adaptation is introduced by having self-
organization of many attractors. That is, if a system is too rigid to
change its behavior, no adaptation is expected. In such a case, the system
has a stubborn single attracting state. If a system is merely enforced by
external changes and cannot restore its original behavior, it is not taken
as an adaptive system. This case also corresponds to a single attracting
state. Instead, having many attractors and being able to switch from one
attractor to another is considered as adaptation. To quantitatively discuss
this argument, we study the adaptation of the Internet by studying its
backbone architecture, called packet switching network (PSN). Our
hypothesis here is that what makes the Internet robust and adaptive can be
attributed to its inherent dynamics of PSN. Robust information transfer is
essentially controlled by a congestion window size adaptation called cwnd.
Varying the input flows to the PSN system, we investigate the possible self-
organization of attractors in cwnd time series and discuss the adaptability
of PSN and the Internet.

## Theory
### Computation: Algorithmic & Dynamic

*“Science and technology are, no doubt, instances of creative activities, and if it is impossible to define art, it will also be impossible to define ‘a machine’. Nay, nature is creative, and new species of plants and animals are always likely to emerge, and as a
result even ‘plant’ and ‘animal’ would have to remain ‘open’ concepts.”*     
-Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz, ‘What is Art? The Problem of the Definition Today’, 1971.

Is this a characteristics of computation - a dynamic organization of inter-related ‘processes’?

####  Is computation algorithmic?
- Algorithm: a process or set of rules to be followed step-by-step in calculations or other problem-solving operations.
- [Computation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation): the process of applying an algorithm to an input in order to obtain an output.
- Computer programs consist of sets of algorithms.
- *"Computational algorithms can reproduce any formalizable process."* - Alan Turing, 1936
- We need to understand how computation can connect distinct systems of thought through a common generality of ‘algorithm’
- Many different kinds of formal processes have been translated into computational instantiations, including not only scientific and mathematical models but also speculative artistic ideas such as Casey Reas’ Process project.

### Casey Reas’ Process project 
- [Process Compendium 2004-2010](http://reas.com/) is a collection of work and record of process by Casey Reas, co-founder of Processing, presented and created entirely in Processing. 

#### Artist statement

- Open lecture / Artist Statement app

"**An Element** is a simple machine that is comprised of **a Form** and **one or more Behaviors**. **A Process** defines **an environment for Elements** and determines **how the relationships between the Elements are visualized**. For instance, Element 1 takes the form of a circle and one of its behaviors moves it along a straight line at a constant speed. Process 4 fills a surface with Element 1 and draws a line between elements while they overlap. Each Process is a short text that defines a space to explore through multiple interpretations. **A Process interpretation in software is a kinetic drawing machine with a beginning but no defined end.** It proceeds one step at a time, and at each discrete step, every Element modifies itself according to its behaviors. The corresponding visual forms emerge as the Elements change; each adjustment adds to the previously drawn shapes. During the last seven years, I have continuously refined the system of Forms, Behaviors, Elements, and Processes. The phenomenon of emergence is the core of the exploration and each artwork builds on previous works and informs the next. The system is idiosyncratic and pseudo-scientific, containing references ranging from the history of mathematics to the generation of artificial life. The Process Compendium 2004-2010 consists of two editions of fifteen prints that document Process 4 to Process 18. In each case, two static images have been selected from an infinite number of potential variations. This book documents these prints, alternate software interpretations, and the emergence of the forms through a series of time-lapse images.

The most important element of Process <NUMBER> is the text. The text is the Process described in English, written with the intent to translate its content into software. The Elements, Forms, and Behaviors referenced within the Process text are defined in the Library. The software interpretation is secondary to the text. The text leaves many decisions open to the programmer, decisions that must be made using personal judgment. The act of translating the Process from English into a machine language interprets the text. Process <NUMBER> was implemented by <NAME> into the <LANGUAGE> language in <YEAR>. The hardware is inconsequential and in time it will fail. It was selected to be robust, but electronic devices are fragile. If a component of the hardware fails, it may be replaced without diminishing the work. Eventually, compatible components won't be available. When this happens, a new hardware system must be acquired and the software modified for the new platform." 

- The first three Process works are named Structure 1, 2, and 3. They were created for the [{Software} Structures project](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures/map.html)
 
- He uses multi-agent systems of *Braitenberg* (Braitenberg, 1986) vehicles to create static two-dimensional prints.

### Braitenberg Vehicles
[A Braitenberg vehicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Braitenberg)  is a concept conceived in a thought experiment by the Italian-Austrian cyberneticist Valentino Braitenberg to illustrate in an evolutive way the abilities of simple intelligent agent. The vehicle represents the simplest form of behavior based artificial intelligence and embodied cognition, i.e. intelligent behavior that emerges from sensorimotor interaction between the agent and its environment, without any need for an internal memory, representation of the environment, or inference. - *Wikepedia*

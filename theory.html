## Inspiration: [*Colorimetry in Motion*](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/colorimetry-in-motion-study-of-colour-by-nicolas-menard/)
We had a discussion about the project after we watched the intro-video of the project all together.
Here are some discussions and students' responses: 
### What do you think the subject of the project? (What/Why)
- Express sound through color and shapes, behaviors.
- Express color and shapes, behaviors through sound.
### What do you think in terms of the quality of the project?
- Color looks random, then it was not very inspiring.
- Movie is buffering but I can not understand why they put the long pause.
- Moving patterns were very boring.
- Speed of animation was organic not linear.
- The sound choice was very interesting because it was matching perfectly.

## Assignment II (by next class)

- Read **What is new media? by Lev Manovich** (The MIT press, 2001) by next class [pdf link](http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335217109.pdf) : this pdf is not completed. You can go [this link](http://www.manovich.net/LNM/Manovich.pdf) to read the chapter 1 from the book 'The Language of New Media.' p43-74.

2. Discuss about the subject of team and decide your role in the team: e.g., communicator, creator, logger, developer and so on.   
3. Submit the log(record) file which shows 'the goal and overview of the project, credits, a final format, and a schedule'

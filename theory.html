## Inspiration: [*Colorimetry in Motion*](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/colorimetry-in-motion-study-of-colour-by-nicolas-menard/)
We had a discussion about the project after we watched the intro-video of the project all together.
Here are some discussions and students' responses: 
### What do you think the subject of the project? (What/Why)
- Express sound through color and shapes, behaviors.
- Express color and shapes, behaviors through sound.
### What do you think in terms of the quality of the project?
- Color looks random, then it was not very inspiring.
- Movie is buffering but I can not understand why they put the long pause.
- Moving patterns were very boring.
- Speed of animation was organic not linear.
- The sound choice was very interesting because it was matching perfectly.
- The most aesthetically pleasing results are often close to nature.

## Assignment II (by next class)

- Read **What is new media? by Lev Manovich** (The MIT press, 2001) by next class [pdf link](http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335217109.pdf) : this pdf is not completed. You can go [this link](http://www.manovich.net/LNM/Manovich.pdf) to read the chapter 1 from the book 'The Language of New Media.' p43-74.

--- 

### Lev Manovich’s analyses of how, through “computerization”, media became new media:
“All existing media are translated into numerical data accessible for the computer. The result: graphics, moving images, sounds, shapes, spaces, and texts become computable, that is, simply sets of computer data ... This meeting changes the identity of both media and the computer itself. No longer just a calculator, control mechanism, or communication device, the computer becomes a media processor.” (Manovich, 2001)

### Nest step 
Once you choose your team, the next things you need to do:   

1. Meet your collaborators and introduce yourself.    
2. Discuss about the subject of team and decide your role in the team: e.g., communicator, creator, logger, developer and so on.   
3. Submit the log(record) file which shows 'the goal and overview of the project, credits, a final format, and a schedule'     
[link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18FSlBD4lwbeZBVEysGNwyJoEKpnGcpDOikRnQPo8JSY/viewform)
4. With the result, let's discuss on details.

## First team meeting (March 10th)
- T1: 곽선근, 정승기, 이호원, 최하은

> - Subject: Creating final media installation contents(ideation) through research about various new media environments.	
> - Overview: Creating final media installation contents(ideation) through research about various new media environments.	Our project will focus on reasearch about new media installations exhibited acroos vast amounts of space, creating immersive environments. (ex. Rain Room and Laser Forest). We will also have case studies on new media works in virtual reality projected across dome-shaped structures. Furthermore, our project will research about exhibiting virtual immersive environments through virtual reality headsets (ex. Oculus Rift). Our studies will be carried out from diverse perspectives - themes and philosophy behind work, aesthetics, and what kinds of tools and technology were utilized in order to create the artwork. We will also ask ourseleves what the role of "space" is in these immersive environments, how the works manipulate space, and how space can be manipulated inside virtual reality. 	
> - Member: 선근 is the communicator, 선근 will keep suggesting extension of idea, and will convey the main gist to the audience in class. 하은 is the logger who will keep track of everything(thoughts, ideas, inspirations, and suggestions) done and observed, 호원and 승기 is in charge of creating the final content of the research in the form of a video. We plan to actively share thoughts and ideas to make the best output.
> - Submission format: Something else.	
> - Schedule: studies on new media installations exhibited across vast space - 3 weeks
works with projection of new media work - 2 weeks(overlap)
virtual immersive environments through virtual reality headsets - 2 weeks(Overlap)
Creating Final Contents - 2weeks (Overlap)
> - Comments: The final format that we want to suggest will be in the form of a video. It may be a single video, or different set of video. 호원 and 승기 are planning to find the best way to share the idea of immersive media environments talking with 선근. It may be a form of interactive video.

After learning basic contents of processing, we will make our own work respectively using 'processing'.
> - Because our group is consisted of many other majors not the art & tech, we are not familiar with this major.
So, we want professor to consider that our group and other groups go together in the class not too fast.
And we want to see many great artworks related to digital media art.

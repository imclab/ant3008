# Max/MSP/Jitter

> Max is a visual programming language for music and multimedia developed and maintained by San Francisco-based software company Cycling '74. During its 20-year history, it has been widely used by composers, performers, software designers, researchers, and artists for creating innovative recordings, performances, and installations. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software))

&lt;img src="img/jitter_screenshot_example.png" align="right" &gt;

It is a "software for innovation and exploration" whose goal is to allow you to "connect anything", to "explore sounds, images and interfaces in new combinations", through a "fluid, visual and immediate process" in which you can "see and hear the results with every change you make." [cycling74](http://cycling74.com/products/max/)

It is one of the most widely used platforms for digital arts and computer music research today. It supports OSX and Windows currently, integrates sound, graphics (2D and 3D) at high and low levels, and integrates with a remarkable range of other tools, devices and systems, especially through the large number of [user-authored extensions](http://www.maxobjects.com/).

Max programs are called 'patches', in reference to the inspiration from analog modular audio synthesizers, in which processing modules (oscillators, filters, etc.) are connected together by wires. In Max, programs are written in a visual style by connecting objects (processing modules) together with patch-cords (wires). This is called visual data-flow programming. Objects perform operations on data received at their inputs and send the results along the wires connected to their outputs.

### Getting Max

Max/MSP is commercial software and supports Mac OSX and Windows. You can [download a demo version](http://www.cycling74.com) for a month's use or you can [purchase a student-priced  version](http://cycling74.com/shop/individual-academic/) if you donâ€™t have other access to the software. The TA will have USB dongles with Max/MSP/Jitter licenses available for use during class and lab times.

### Support materials and references

The materials included within the Max/MSP/Jitter application (help & reference, examples and other documentation) and the [Max website](http://cycling74.com/category/articles/tutorials/) are probably the best resources available.
